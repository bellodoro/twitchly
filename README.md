# Twitchly.co - Twitch Chat Monitor



**Twitchly** is side project of Vanila Team which monitor twhich chat channels and provide some stats.

Main idea for this project was to get idea how fast twitch chat is, or whats most popular word.

As being on Twitch Chat last 5 years 24/7, I (Stefan Smiljkovic), wanted to extract some interesting stats from twitch chat.

With 100+ milion monthly unqiue users, Twitch can be great platform to analyze and experiment.
